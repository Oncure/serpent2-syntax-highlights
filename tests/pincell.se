% --- Geometry plots
%     First two plots are perpendicular to z-axis i.e. xy-plots (3)

% --- First plot is 200 by 200 pixels and covers the whole geometry: -0.75 < (x,y) < 0.75

plot 3  200  200

% --- Second plot is 1000 by 1000 pixels, from axial height z = 0.0 
%     and covers more than the whole geometry: -2.25 < (x,y) < 2.25
